        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.
            (Read James Naismith’s 1929 Britannica essay on his invention of basketball.)
            The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about December 1, 1891, at the International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>The rules governing play of the game are based on Naismith’s five principles requiring a large, light ball,
             handled with the hands; no running with the ball; 
            no player being restricted from getting the ball when it is in play; no personal contact; 
            and a horizontal, elevated goal. The rules are spelled out in specific detail by the governing bodies of the several 
            branches of the sport and cover the playing court and equipment, officials, players, scoring and timing, fouls, 
            violations, and other matters. The officials include a referee and two umpires in college play 
            (two referees and a crew chief in NBA play), two timers, and two scorekeepers. One player on each team acts as 
            captain and speaks for the team on all matters involving the officials, such as interpretation of rules. Professional, international, and high school games are 
            divided into four periods, college games into two.</p>

            <h2>Best Game Ever</h2>
            <p>The Celtics' epic triple-overtime victory over the Suns in Game 5 of the 1976 Finals is often referred to as 
                'the greatest game ever played. ' Boston and Phoenix waged a triple-OT thriller in the 1976 Finals.
